    This API allows you to write your application logic in Java and 
    present it using modern HTML rendering technologies like 
    <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
    <img src="doc-files/html4j.png">.
    </p>
    <p>
    Use <a href="Model.html">@Model</a> annotation to define one or more
    model classes with <a href="Property.html">properties</a>. Don't waste
    time writing setters or getters - they will be generated for you. 
    Just instantiate your classes and use them!
    </p>
    <p>
    The class generator does not stop with getters and setters -- internally
    it generates bindings for various HTML technologies. Just include appropriate
    technology implementation on classpath of your application and your model
    class(es) will automatically be bound to your HTML elements (after calling
    <code>applyBindings()</code> on your model).
    </p>
    <p>
    You don't have bother with JavaScript. All your application logic is in
    Java. The necessary JavaScript needed for the HTML bindings remains hidden
    as an implementation detail of communication between the generated model
    class(es) and appropriate technology bridge (like artifact with id <code>ko-fx</code>
    and group id <code>org.apidesign.html</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
    The model classes can be used for JSON based server communication. Just
    use <a href="OnReceive.html">@OnReceive</a> annotation to define a communication
    point in the model class. Please note, that the model classes can easily
    be used on server as well (tested with Jersey) - the same code can run
    in your browser as well as on your server.
    </p>
    <p>
    Behavior of model classes can be enriched by using 
    <a href="ComputedProperty.html">@ComputedProperty</a> annotation (to
    define <em>derived</em> properties) and by 
    <a href="Function.html">@Function</a> annotation to define handlers
    to be invoked from the HTML elements.
    </p>
