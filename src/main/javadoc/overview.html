        <p>
         Use Java to write application logic; Use HTML5 to render the UI; 
         {@link net.java.html.json.Model Animate an HTML page from Java};
         Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive REST} or
         <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>;
         interact with <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScript</a>;
         Get the best of both worlds!
         
         The goal of these APIs is to use full featured Java runtime 
         (like real <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HotSpot">HotSpot VM</a>), 
         but still rely on a very lightweight rendering technology 
         (so it can potentially fit 
         <a href="http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org">Bck2Brwsr</a> and definitely
         to various types of phones). What can be more lightweight 
         (from a browser perspective) than 
         <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>!?
         By default we use {@link net.java.html.boot.fx JavaFX's WebView} 
         component to display the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. 
         We eliminate the need to manipulate the DOM directly, 
         there is a special {@link net.java.html.json Java to Knockout.js binding}. 
         As a result the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">HTML uses Knockout.js syntax</a>, 
         yet the application code can be written in Java.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Interesting Entry Points</h3>
        
        <p>Learn how to {@link net.java.html.json.Model animate an HTML page from Java}
            without referencing single HTML element from the Java code.
        </p>
        <p>Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive JSON} to communicate
            with REST based server API.
        </p>
        <p>Use <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>
            and JSON.
        </p>
        <p>Call JavaScript methods from Java and vice versa, via
            <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScriptBody</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        There are many ways to start developing 
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a> application. 
        However to be sure one chooses the most recent setup, it is recommended
        to switch to good old command line and use a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">Maven archetype</a>
        associated with every version of this project. Just type:
        <pre>      
$ mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apidesign.html \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=knockout4j-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.7.5 <em># or newer version, if available</em>
        </pre>
        Answer few questions (for example choose myfirstbrwsrpage as artifactId) and then you can:
        <pre>
$ cd myfirstbrwsrpage
$ mvn process-classes exec:java
        </pre>
        In a few seconds (or minutes if 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        decides to download the whole Internet of dependencies) you should 
        see a sample Hello World application. It is basically composed from one 
        Java and one HTML file:
        <pre>
$ ls src/main/java/**/DataModel.java
$ ls src/main/webapp/pages/index.html
        </pre>
        Play with them, modify them and enjoy
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a>!

        The javadoc for latest and previous versions is also available
        online:
