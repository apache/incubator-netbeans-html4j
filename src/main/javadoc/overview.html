        <p>
         Use Java to write application logic; Use HTML5 to render the UI; 
         {@link net.java.html.json.Model Animate an HTML page from Java};
         Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive REST} or
         <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>;
         interact with <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScript</a>;
         Get the best of both worlds!
         
         The goal of these APIs is to use full featured Java runtime 
         (like real <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HotSpot">HotSpot VM</a>), 
         but still rely on a very lightweight rendering technology 
         (so it can potentially fit 
         <a href="http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org">Bck2Brwsr</a> and definitely
         to various types of phones). What can be more lightweight 
         (from a browser perspective) than 
         <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>!?
         By default we use {@link net.java.html.boot.fx JavaFX's WebView} 
         component to display the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. 
         We eliminate the need to manipulate the DOM directly, 
         there is a special {@link net.java.html.json Java to Knockout.js binding}. 
         As a result the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">HTML uses Knockout.js syntax</a>, 
         yet the application code can be written in Java.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Interesting Entry Points</h3>
        
        <p>Learn how to {@link net.java.html.json.Model animate an HTML page from Java}
            without referencing single HTML element from the Java code.
        </p>
        <p>Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive JSON} to communicate
            with REST based server API.
        </p>
        <p>Use <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>
            and JSON.
        </p>
        <p>Call JavaScript methods from Java and vice versa, via
            <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScriptBody</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        There are many ways to start developing 
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a> application. 
        However to be sure one chooses the most recent setup, it is recommended
        to switch to good old command line and use a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">Maven archetype</a>
        associated with every version of this project. Make sure at least 
        <em>JDK7</em> is your installed Java and type:
        <pre>      
$ mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apidesign.html \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=knockout4j-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.7.5 <em># or newer version, if available</em>
        </pre>
        Answer few questions (for example choose myfirstbrwsrpage as artifactId) 
        and then you can:
        <pre>
$ cd myfirstbrwsrpage
$ mvn process-classes exec:java
        </pre>
        In a few seconds (or minutes if 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        decides to download the whole Internet of dependencies) you should 
        see a sample Hello World application rendered in a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>
        web view component (that of course requires your JDK to come
        with <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>; 
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK7 
            and JDK8 from Oracle</a> contain everything that is needed). 
        The generated application is built around one 
        Java source (uses the {@link net.java.html.json.Model} annotation to
        auto-generate another <code>Data.java</code> class during compilation)
        and one HTML file (uses the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
        syntax to <code>data-bind</code> the HTML elements to the 
        generated <code>Data</code> model):
        <pre>
$ ls src/main/java/**/DataModel.java
$ ls src/main/webapp/pages/index.html
        </pre>
        That is all you need to get started. Play with the sources, 
        modify them and enjoy
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a>!
        
        <h2>IDE Support</h2>
        
        <p>
            This API is part of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans.org</a> project and as such
            it works naturally with the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://netbeans.org/features/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>.
            On the other hand, the API is using nothing NetBeans specific,
            it builds on standard Java6 APIs and as such it shall work fine
            in any IDE.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A lot of work is done by 
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">
            annotation processors</a>
            that generate various boiler plate code during compilation. This
            is a standard part of Java since JDK6, but for example Eclipse
            is known not to deal with processors well and developers using
            it need to be careful. IntelliJ users hasn't reported any issues
            and of course, NetBeans IDE support for 
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">processors</a>
            is outstanding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When using {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation, it is
            useful to do a bit of post processing of classes. There is a
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a> 
            plugin for that.
            NetBeans IDE will invoke it when doing a build. Other IDEs may 
            need some hint to do so. 
            Anyway: If one does not see all (generated) sources or is getting
            {@link java.lang.LinkageError}s when executing the application, 
            switch to command line and do clean build
            from there:
        </p>
        <pre>$ mvn clean install</pre>
        <p>
            If that succeeds, your IDE of choice will hopefully
            pick the generated sources up and present the result of the build 
            properly. If not, 
            <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">download NetBeans</a>, 
            you will be pleasantly 
            surprised - for example with our excellent 
            <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html#debugging">Java/JavaScript 
            debugging</a> support.
        </p>
