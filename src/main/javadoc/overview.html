    <body>
        <p>
         Use Java to write application logic; Use HTML5 to render the UI; 
         {@link net.java.html.json.Model Animate an HTML page from Java}
         (see <a href="http://dew.apidesign.org/dew/#7212206">Duke being rotated</a> by CSS);
         Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive REST} or
         <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>;
         interact with <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScript</a>;
         Get the best of both worlds!
         
         The goal of these APIs is to use full featured Java runtime 
         (like real <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HotSpot">HotSpot VM</a>), 
         but still rely on a very lightweight rendering technology 
         (so it can potentially fit 
         <a href="http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org">Bck2Brwsr</a> and definitely
         to various types of phones). What can be more lightweight 
         (from a browser perspective) than 
         <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>!?
         By default we use {@link net.java.html.boot.fx JavaFX's WebView} 
         component to display the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. 
         We eliminate the need to manipulate the DOM directly, 
         there is a special {@link net.java.html.json Java to Knockout.js binding}. 
         As a result the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">HTML uses Knockout.js syntax</a>, 
         yet the application code can be written in Java.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What's New in Version 0.8.1?</h3>
        
        <p>
            This is mostly a bugfix release. The annotation processor is made
            more robust with respect to errors in callback syntax of
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} body parameter.
            Javadoc of {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute} method
            has been improved based on a failure of its usability study.
            There can be additional parameters to methods annotated by
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} that allows one to
            pass state when a JSON call is made and use it when it finishes.
            The mechanism of discovery of sibling HTML page has been
            extended to work on systems that don't support
            {@link java.lang.Class#getProtectionDomain}.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What's New in Version 0.8?</h3>
        
        <p>
            The first argument of method annotated by
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} annotation has to
            be the associated {@link net.java.html.json.Model model class}.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} annotation now accepts
            {@link java.util.List} of data values as second argument
            (previously required an array).
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>What's New in Older Versions?</h3>
        
        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation has new attribute
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody#wait4js()} which allows
            asynchronous execution. Libraries using
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} are urged to use this
            new attribute as much as possible, as it can speed up execution
            in certain environments.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Use {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute(java.lang.Runnable)} in
            multi-threaded environment to execute your code on the browser thread.
            See example 
            {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute(java.lang.Runnable) using Java timer}.
        </p>

            without referencing single HTML element from the Java code.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        There are many ways to start developing 
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a> application. 
        However to be sure one chooses the most recent setup, it is recommended
        to switch to good old command line and use a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">Maven archetype</a>
        associated with every version of this project. Make sure at least 
        <em>JDK7</em> is your installed Java and type:
        <pre>      
$ mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apidesign.html \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=knockout4j-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.7.5 <em># or newer version, if available</em>
        </pre>
        Answer few questions (for example choose myfirstbrwsrpage as artifactId) 
        and then you can:
        <pre>
$ cd myfirstbrwsrpage
$ mvn process-classes exec:java
        </pre>
        In a few seconds (or minutes if 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        decides to download the whole Internet of dependencies) you should 
        see a sample Hello World application rendered in a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>
        web view component (that of course requires your JDK to come
        with <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>; 
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK7 
            and JDK8 from Oracle</a> contain everything that is needed). 
        The generated application is built around one 
        Java source (uses the {@link net.java.html.json.Model} annotation to
        auto-generate another <code>Data.java</code> class during compilation)
        and one HTML file (uses the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
        syntax to <code>data-bind</code> the HTML elements to the 
        generated <code>Data</code> model):
        <pre>
$ ls src/main/java/**/DataModel.java
$ ls src/main/webapp/pages/index.html
        </pre>
        That is all you need to get started. Play with the sources, 
        modify them and enjoy
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a>!
        
        <h2>IDE Support</h2>
        
        <p>
            This API is part of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans.org</a> project and as such
            it works naturally with the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://netbeans.org/features/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>.
            On the other hand, the API is using nothing NetBeans specific,
            it builds on standard Java6 APIs and as such it shall work fine
            in any IDE.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A lot of work is done by 
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">
            annotation processors</a>
            that generate various boiler plate code during compilation. This
            is a standard part of Java since JDK6, but for example Eclipse
            is known not to deal with processors well and developers using
            it need to be careful. IntelliJ users hasn't reported any issues
            and of course, NetBeans IDE support for 
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">processors</a>
            is outstanding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When using {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation, it is
            useful to do a bit of post processing of classes. There is a
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a> 
            plugin for that.
            NetBeans IDE will invoke it when doing a build. Other IDEs may 
            need some hint to do so. 
            Anyway: If one does not see all (generated) sources or is getting
            {@link java.lang.LinkageError}s when executing the application, 
            switch to command line and do clean build
            from there:
        </p>
        <pre>$ mvn clean install</pre>
        <p>
            If that succeeds, your IDE of choice will hopefully
            pick the generated sources up and present the result of the build 
            properly. If not, 
            <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">download NetBeans</a>, 
            you will be pleasantly 
            surprised - for example with our excellent 
            <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html#debugging">Java/JavaScript 
            debugging</a> support.

        <p>
        It is not goal of this documentation to list all possible ways
        to package and deploy applications which use this API. However it is 
        important for new comers to see the benefits of using the
        <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> API and as such
        let's list at least few bundling options, known to work at the time of writing 
        this documentation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        First of all, this is a <em>client technology</em>. You write client applications
        with it which may, but need not connect to a server. You don't need
        Tomcat or WebLogic to deploy 
        <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> applications.
        </p>

            The sample project generated by
            <code>org.apidesign.html knockout4j-archetype</code> is configured
            to use <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>
            as the rendering technology. This setup is primarily suitable for 
            development - it needs no special packaging, starts quickly and
            allows you to use classical HotSpot VM debuggers. A final 
            artifact from the build is also a ZIP file which you can use
            and distribute to your users. Good for desktop applications.

            All the <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> libraries
            are packaged as <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a>
            bundles and as such they can easily be run in NetBeans as well as
            in Eclipse. As a result one can use 
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a>
            and have a common module system for both platforms. In addition to that 
            one can render using
            HTML and have a common UI in both platforms. In such case
            your application would be packaged as a set of
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a> bundles.

            There is more and more attempts to execute Java bytecode
            in a browser, without any special Java plugin installed.
            The <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> is
            carefully designed to produce lightweight, well performing
            applications even on such restricted environments. It uses
            no reflection calls and that allows to statically pre-compile
            the applications into JavaScript. One of such environments
            is called <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Bck2Brwsr">Bck2Brwsr</a>, 
            another <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/TeaVM">TeaVM</a>. Both support the
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation. Read

            Now when we have seen that the 
            <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> applications 
            can run on any modern browser, we can ask whether they can also
            fit into a phone!? Yes, they can and especially to phones 
            that can execute Java code already! Just by changing your
            packaging you can create an APK file and deploy it to your
            Android phone.

            In case you'd like your application to reach out to second biggest
            group of smartphone users, don't despair: It 
            seems the set of devices that can execute
            <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> applications 
            has been extended to <em>iPads</em> and <em>iPhones</em>. Get the

            Convinced it makes sense to use 
            <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a>
            APIs for writing applications that are 
            <em>written once, displayed anywhere</em>? Or do you have an

            <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a>
